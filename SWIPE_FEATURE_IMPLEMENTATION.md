## 💡 Key Differences from Browse

| Feature | Browse (/roommates) | Swipe (/swipe) |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| Layout | Vertical list/feed | Card stack |
| Interaction | Scroll, filter, click | Swipe gestures |
| Decision | Browse all, selective | Quick yes/no |
| Filters | Advanced filters visible | Clean, minimal UI |
| Navigation | Traditional pagination | Sequential cards |
| Use Case | Detailed comparison | Fast discovery |

Both modes coexist, giving users choice in how they browse!
